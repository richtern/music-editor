This is a project I made with a partner, Luke Bakker, my 2nd year at Northeastern. The end result is a music player that allows the user to play, pause, or restart the audio and visual scrolling of the song. Additionally, the user can scroll through the visual representation of the song notes. This project implements MVC architecture.
